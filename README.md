This Python script utilizes Selenium to automate searches on the DuckDuckGo search engine. It defines a class named Duckduckgo, which inherits from the Chrome WebDriver. The script navigates to DuckDuckGo's main page, performs a search using a specified term, and retrieves and prints the titles and URLs of the search results. The automation supports loading additional result pages by clicking the "more" button. Users can integrate this script into their projects to automate DuckDuckGo searches and gather relevant information from the search results.

# Run the line below on the terminal:
python run.py '"term to search"'
